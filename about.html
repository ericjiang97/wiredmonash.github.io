          WIRED Monash is the student club for those studying IT or those who are curious about everything digital at Monash University
          Clayton.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to provide a relaxed, social atmosphere where students can meet others who share their love for everything digital.
          Our community is one where we can share our opinions on the latest technology, and collaborate on projects and
          competitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also provide our members the opportunity to connect with some of Australia's leading technology companies through our
          many sponsored lunchtime events and networking opportunities - such as our Industry Night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Past events that we have held include our Annual Trivia Night, Midnight-to-Dawn Laser Tag, and the hugely successful
          <a

            hackathon competition. We also hold workshops to allow students to expand their knowledge such as data visualisation and
            cyber security.
        </p>
