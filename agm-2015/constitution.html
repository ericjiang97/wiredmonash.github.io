        <p class="center">
          At the AGM, the committee plans to move a series of amendments to the constitution. We believe that these additions are necessary
          to allow more people to contribute - either as a committee member or a subcommittee member - and to ensure the club continues to be the
          premier IT student society at Monash University Clayton.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          A two-thirds majority of members present at the AGM<sup>1</sup> is required to pass these amendments. As such, we ask that all members
          view the changes that we propose to the constitution and vote in favour.

    <h3>Why Change?</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
        <p class="center">
          When WIRED was established, we were created in response to the collapse of another IT student society at Monash University Clayton Campus,
          the Monash Information Technology Society. As such, we were a very small club with less than 100 members.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          Today, we are a club that has over <strong>400</strong> members that come from almost every faculty at Monash University. We are the organisers of
          UNIHACK, Melbourne's premier hackathon that is open to all university and TAFE students from across Australia. We have also improved our
          relationship with the Faculty of Information Technology, thanks to the tireless efforts of both the President and the Secretary; and
          forged close ties with some key industry partners - such as our platinum sponsor PwC.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          Next year, the club anticipates that our membership numbers will grow significantly as the Faculty of Information Technology will move
          all of its undergraduate courses to Clayton. As a result, this could push our membership numbers to the 500-600 range in 2016.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          As such, the committee believes the existing constitution needs to be changed so we can continue to be relevant and support our members in
          future years.

    <h3>Promoting Diversity</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
        <p class="center">
          Promoting diversity in IT is very important to us, and we believe that we can play some role in helping bringing more women and minorities into the IT industry.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          As such, we plan to add to a diversity portfolio to the responsibilities of the Vice President. This means that he or she will act as our liaison between the
          faculty, similar student groups (e.g. Robogals and Geek Girl Coffee Club) and the greater IT industry to promote diversity to members and the wider student
          community. In addition, they must act as the voice of equal opportunity and diversity for all club decisions and at all club events.

          This follows on from our Diversity Commitment that we implemented for UNIHACK 2015 - where we wanted to increase the participation of women and
          minorities at our event. After reaching out with LGBT and Women in ICT student groups (like Robogals), we were able to increase the number of
          women competing by 260 percent. We also made sure that the judging panel had a rough even split between male and female panelists.

    <h3>New Positions</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
        <p class="center">
          We plan to increase the number of people on the committee from seven to ten people, with the creation of three new roles: the Activities Officer,
          Education Officer, and Industry Officer. We believe that by increasing the number of office bearer positions, this will help us add more talented
          and hard-working people to the committee.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          We have also created the roles in response to the increasing number of de-facto responsibilites that the committee members have adopted over the
          years. For example, our Secretary was also industry liaison, a co-organiser of the Tech Industry Night (held with SMEE and MECC) and UNIHACK,
          marketing officer, sponsorship organiser, and faculty liaison. As we believe that this will be a huge burden to our sucessors, we have moved
          many of these responsibilites to the three new positions.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          For more details about their responsibilities, see the Election page. If passed, these roles will also be up for election at the AGM.

    <h3>Subcommittees</h3>

      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
        <p class="center">
          Lastly, we plan to codify the rules of subcommittees so there is a process that future committees and all our members are aware of and can follow.
          Establishing subcommittees allow all of our members - both ordinary and associate members - to play some part in making WIRED the best IT student
          society at Monash University.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          We envision that subcommittees will be used to organise our flagship events such as UNIHACK, or create smaller club-like groups that can utilise
          our resources and industry connections (e.g. cybersecurity, programming, competing in hackathons, etc).
