        <p class="headline">We are updating the constitution</p>
        <p class="center">
          At the AGM, the committee plans to move a series of amendments to the constitution. We believe that these additions are necessary
          to allow more people to contribute - either as a committee member or a subcommittee member - and to ensure the club continues to be the
          premier IT student society at Monash University Clayton.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          A two-thirds majority of members present at the AGM<sup>1</sup> is required to pass these amendments. As such, we ask that all members
          view the changes that we propose to the constitution and vote in favour.

    <h3>New Positions</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
        <p class="center">
          We plan to increase the number of people on the committee from seven to ten people, with the creation of three new roles: the Activities Officer,
          Education Officer, and Industry Officer. We believe that by increasing the number of office bearer positions, this will help us add more talented
          and hard-working people to the committee.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          We have also created the roles in response to the increasing number of de-facto responsibilites that some of our committee members have taken on
          in the past two years. For example, our Secretary was also one of the co-organiser of the Tech Industry Night (held with SMEE and MECC),
          a creator and organiser UNIHACK, marketing officer, sponsorship organiser, industry liaison, and faculty liaison.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          If we continue doing this, it will be a massive burden for future committees. As such, we have decided to move these responsibilities
          to the three newly-created roles.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          For more details about their responsibilities, see the Election page. If passed, these roles will also be up for election at the AGM.

    <h3>Promoting Diversity</h3>

        <p class="center">
          Promoting diversity in IT is very important to us, and we believe that we can play some role in helping bringing more women and minorities into the IT industry.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          As such, we plan to add to a diversity portfolio to the responsibilities of the Vice President. This means that he or she will act as our liaison between the
          faculty, similar student groups (e.g. Robogals and Geek Girl Coffee Club) and the greater IT industry to promote diversity to members and the wider student
          community. In addition, they must act as the voice of equal opportunity and diversity for all club decisions and at all club events.

          This follows on from our Diversity Commitment that we implemented for UNIHACK 2015 - where we wanted to increase the participation of women and
          minorities at our event. After reaching out with LGBT and Women in ICT student groups (like Robogals), we were able to increase the number of
          women competing by 260 percent. We also made sure that the judging panel had a rough even split between male and female panelists.

    <h3>Subcommittees</h3>

      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
        <p class="center">
          Lastly, we plan to codify the rules of subcommittees so there is a process that future committees and all our members are aware of and can follow.
          Establishing subcommittees allow all of our members - both ordinary and associate members - to play some part in making WIRED the best IT student
          society at Monash University.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          We envision that subcommittees will be used to organise our flagship events such as UNIHACK, or create smaller club-like groups that can utilise
          our resources and industry connections (e.g. cybersecurity, programming, competing in hackathons, etc).
