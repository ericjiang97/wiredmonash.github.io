        <p class="center">
          At this year's Annual General Meeting, the committee plans to introduce a series of amendments to the
          club's constitution. The amendments include introducing new positions to the committee, assigning the
          diversity portfolio to the Vice President, and the creation of subcommittees.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          The amendments require a two-thirds majority of all voting members present at the AGM (plus quorum)
          in order to pass. As such, we ask that all of our members read the changes, so you are aware of the
          proposed changes and vote accordingly.

          When WIRED was established six years ago, we were a very small club that was created after the collapse
          of another IT student society.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          Now, WIRED has over 400 members who are studying IT or interested in all things digital. We are the
          organisers of UNIHACK, Melbourne's premier hackathon for university students; and have begun work in
          starting a series of Tech Talks, where people (regardless of faculty) can learn more about technology and
          issues from the people who are passionate about them.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          In addition, thanks to the tireless efforts of both the Secretary and President, we have a much better
          relationship with the Faculty of Information Technology, and established relationships with several
          companies in the industry &ndash; like PwC, Deloitte, EY, Commonwealth Bank, Australia Post, Zendesk and Atlassian.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          However, this was all done by adding additional responsibilities to several members of the committee.
          We believe that the added responsibilities will be a massive burden to future committee members,
          and hence are unsustainable.
        <p>
        <p class="center">
          As such, we plan to create of three new roles: Activities Officer, Education Officer, and Industry Officer.
          For more details about their responsibilities, see the Election page.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          If passed, these roles will also be up for election at the AGM.

    <h3>Promoting Diversity</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
        <p class="center">
          Promoting diversity in IT is very important to us, and we believe that we can play some role in
          helping bringing more women and minorities into the IT industry.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          As such, we plan to add to a diversity portfolio to the responsibilities of the Vice President.
          This means that he or she will act as our liaison between the faculty, similar student groups
          (e.g. Robogals and Geek Girl Coffee Club) and the greater IT industry to promote diversity to
          members and the wider student community. In addition, they must act as the voice of equal
          opportunity and diversity for all club decisions and at all club events.

          This follows on from our Diversity Commitment that we implemented for UNIHACK 2015 - where we wanted
          to increase the participation of women and minorities at our event. After reaching out with LGBT and
          Women in ICT student groups, we were able to increase the number of female competitors by 260 percent
          compared to last year. We also ensured that the judging panel was equally diverse &ndash; composing of four
          male and three female judges.

    <h3>Subcommittees</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
        <p class="center">
          Lastly, we plan to codify the rules of subcommittees. We believe that subcommittees are essential so all
          of our members &ndash; both ordinary and associate members &ndash; can meet up if they share similar interests,
          or showcase their skills in leadership and organisation.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          We propose that subcommittees be used for organising some of our flagship events (e.g. Trivia Night,
          Tech Industry Night) or activities; or creating club-like groups where like-minded students can meet,
          using the clubâ€™s resources.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          For example, we can establish a subcommittee for people who are interested in cyber security so they
          can create workshops for everyone to learn the basics, or training sessions so they are prepared
          for events like the Cyber Security Challenge.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          We will open expressions of interest for subcommittees after the AGM.

    <h3>Preparing for the Future</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
        <p class="center">
          We believe that the changes are necessary so we can continue to be the top society for all IT students
          and those who have an interest in all things digital. We also believe that our club can play some part
          in helping the IT industry to be more diverse. We are the future business leaders and &ndash; regardless of
          gender &ndash; be diversity advocates in the companies we join in the future.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          The committee strongly urges that our membership pass the proposed amendments at the AGM.
