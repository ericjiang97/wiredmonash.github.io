          Have your say on the future direction of the club.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is that time of year again - the Annual General Meeting. This is where you get to decide on who will be part of the 2015-16 committee,
          and voice your opinions on where the club should be going. In addition, if you do attend, you can get your hands on the leftover swag
          from UNIHACK 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pending approval from Clubs and Societies, the committee plans to amend the constitution. More details will be made available to all
          our members once it has been given the greenlight by the C&amp;S Executive.
        </p>
        <p>
          We strongly urge that ALL members attend the AGM. If not enough people do not attend the AGM and do not elect a new committee, we will
          not have a club next year. We also strongly urge that those people who wish to be part of the committee attend the AGM so you can put
          your name forward.

        <p class="center">
          Want to be part of the next year's committee? All office bearer positions will be open: President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and
          three general representatives. Pending approval of the constitutional amendments by our members and C&amp;S Executive, we also plan to have
          three new office bearer positions up for election - Activities Officer, Education Officer, and Industry Officer.

        <h3>Constitution Update</h3>
        <p class="center">
          The committee plans to update the constitution to include new positions on the committee and make it more open for members to contribute
          to the club. We believe these changes are necessary given the course changes and to help further cement ourselves as the premier IT
          student society at Monash University Clayton.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          As soon as the changes are approved by the C&amp;S Executive, we will provide more details about the changes we propose on this website.
